	 * Since 25, 50, 75 and 100 have two 5�s in each of them (25 = 5 * 5, 50 = 2 * 5 * 5, �), you have to count them twice. 
	 * This makes the grand total 24. 
	 * For people who like to look at it from a formula point of view 
	 * Number of 5�s = 100/5 + 100/25 + 100/125 + � = 24 (Integer values only)
