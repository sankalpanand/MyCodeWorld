/*
Diff 1 - For implementing Runnable, the run() method needs to be implemented which does not return anything,
while for a Callable, the call() method needs to be implemented which returns a result on completion.
Note that a thread canâ€™t be created with a Callable, it can only be created with a Runnable.

Diff 2 - Another difference is that the call() method can throw an exception whereas run() cannot.
