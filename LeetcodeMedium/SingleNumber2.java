        To represent 3 states, we need two bits
        00 = 0 first occurance
        01 = 1 first occurance
        10 = 2 first occurance

        At every state, we map what will be the next state if this number appears one more time.
        This will give us something like this-

        current   incoming  next
        a b            c    a b
        0 0            0    0 0
        0 1            0    0 1
        1 0            0    1 0
        0 0            1    0 1
        0 1            1    1 0
        1 0            1    0 0

        Now, we need to check what will be the state of two bits after each incoming bits.
        a will be 1 only when 100 and 011

        a= a~b~c + ~abc;
        b= ~ab~c + ~a~bc;

        Now, we can model these bits in our program.

		}

		// We are not sure that the single number appeared 1 time or 2 time.
